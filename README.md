## 1. About The Project

This project started from a personal challenge: recreate **physical principles** in a **simulation** running in **real time**. I also wanted this project to easily **convey some understanding** of how it works, as well as **analysis** and **debugging tools**.

### 1.1. Topics

The objective was to learn more about such topics as:

- **Gravity** (Classical mecanics one, he goal was not to model objects at the molecular level)
- **Collisions** (With Newton's 3rd law)
- **Friction** (Approximation with dissipation in heat)
- **Electromagnetic fields** (_IN WORK_, see <https://github.com/mlhoutel/Fields>)
- **Fluids** (_IN WORK_)

This project also allows me to familiarize myself with several areas of programming, such as:

- **Graph Theory** and advanced **Data structures** like Quadtrees
- **C++ programs/libraries** compilation (Mingw batch/ CMake)
- **Memory allocation** and **Classes Inheritances**
- **Optimisation** and **Algoritmics**
- **Threads** and **Graphical acceleration** with CUDA (?)

As this program is oriented towards testing and comparison, a modular structure has been set up.

### 1.2. Modularity

- **Precision** (at build time):
  - [x] Integers
  - [x] Float
  - [x] Double
- **Dimension** (at build time):
  - [x] 2D
  - [ ] 3D
- **Broad phase structure** (at run time):
  - [ ] Spacial grid
  - [x] Quad-tree
  - [ ] kD-tree
- **Integration method** (at run time):
  - [ ] Euler
  - [x] Verlet
  - [ ] RK4

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

The project is developed according to [c++17 standards](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17).

To build the engine, you will need the [CMake build tool](https://cmake.org/download/) `v3.8+`

You will also need a compiler for `c++17`, make sure yours is compatible (gcc `v8+`, [see support](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17))

The program has been tested with the following compilers:

- **Linux:** GCC ([GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/))
- **Windows:** Mingw ([Minimalist GNU for Windows](https://www.mingw-w64.org/))

### 2.2. Installation

1. Download the project source or clone it with git: `git clone https://github.com/qualeus/engine.git`
2. Create a build directory: `cd engine && mkdir build`
3. Build the project with Cmake: `cd build && cmake -G "YOUR_COMPILER" -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ../..`
4. Build the targets and run tests: `cmake --build . && make CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=TRUE test`
